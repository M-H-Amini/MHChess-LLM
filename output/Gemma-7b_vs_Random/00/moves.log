The game is played on a 10x10 board. The pieces are:
- King (K)
- Rook (R)
- Knight (N)
- Bishop (B)
- Pawn (P)
- King (k)
- Rook (r)
- Knight (n)
- Bishop (b)
- Pawn (p)

The board is represented by a 10x10 grid of dots and letters. The dots represent empty squares, and the letters represent pieces. The pieces are represented by the first letter of their name.

The game is played by moving pieces around the board. A piece can move to any empty square adjacent to it, or to any square that is occupied by an enemy piece. A piece can also capture an enemy piece by moving to the same square as the enemy piece.

The goal of the game is to checkmate the enemy king. Checkmate occurs when the enemy king is in check and there is no legal move for the enemy king to escape check.

The game is played by taking turns. On each turn, a player can make one move. A move consists of selecting a piece and moving it to a new square.

The game is won by the player who checkmates the enemy king.

The game is lost by the player whose king is checkmated.

The game is a draw if neither player can checkmate the other player's king.
