The first character is the column of the piece you want to move, the second character is the row of the piece you want to move, the third character is the column of the square you want to move to, and the fourth character is the row of the square you want to move to.

The board is in the standard algebraic notation. The first line is the white side, the second line is the black side. The pieces are represented by the following characters:

* p - pawn
* n - knight
* b - bishop
* r - rook
* q - queen
* k - king
* K - white king
* B - black king
